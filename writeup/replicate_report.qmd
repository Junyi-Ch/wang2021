<!-- Replication reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects.  These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results.  These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection.  Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information. You will likely contact the authors of the original study, so this should be professional and forward facing. It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

### Short Justification

My research interests centered around language development, learning, and processing. I chose this experiment because I would like to do studies on semantic network, word knowledge, and individual differences. I would like to eventually do this type of studies in children, and I am still trying to poke around to see what might work for my own project. I think this experiment is a good point to start
because it studies how adults differ in their representations of words, and how this depends on the abstractness of words. I would be able to learn specific ways of conducting the experiment and data analysis 
that will be useful for my own study in the future.

### Stimulus and Procedures

#### Stimuli
Stimuli consisted  of  90  written  Chinese words,  of  which  40 were  object  words  and  50  were words  without  explicit  external referents. Words without external referents varied in their  emotional  associations;  20  words  did  not  have emotional connotations,  and  30  were  emotionally  related words (e.g., violence). The list is included in the paper. 

#### Procedures
##### update for oct15th
* I plan to contact the authors for their data analysis and the task. I have also tried out building the task in jspsych, and it seems to work as described in the paper.
* I will try to use their availabel data (https://osf.io/cyusp/overview BehavioralSemanticDistanceMatrix ) to see if I can replicate the results using their data. 
* I plan to reduce the amount of words to decrease the experiment time for participants. Currently it is 1 hour and too long. 
* From what I can understand, their over pipeline is as followed:
  + Task:
    - 90 words displayed around a circular arena on a computer screen
    - subjects drag and drop words to arrange them spatially based on semantic similarity
    - Trial 1: All 90 words arranged, producing a 90 x 90 distance matrix.
    - subsequent trials: adaptively selected word subsets presented for arrangement depending on the original clusters, and subjects completed varying numbers of trials.
  + The adaptive selection process (the part I'm most unsure about)
    - The system maintains an evidence weight matrix for all word pairs. Then, then system finds the weakest evidence pair. Then it adds words by calculating the trial efficieny until adding a word's benefit is not larger than its cost. These words form a subset. 
  + Data Analysis:
    - Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) Analysis: 
    Word representation: Each word represented as an 89-dimensional vector (its distances to all other words)
    Pairwise correlations: Pearson correlations computed between each pair of subjects' word vectors
    Fisher z-transformation: Applied to normalize correlation distributions
    Averaging: Mean correlation across all 190 subject pairs (20 subjects total)
    Result: ISC-behavior score for each word, indicating how consistently that word's semantic relationships are judged across subjects



##### Semantic Judgment Task
Subjects dragged and dropped words in a circular array on a computer screen, arranging them spatially close together or far apart  according  to  the  words’  semantic  distances. Participants do this through multiple trials where each trial contains a subset of the 90 words that were clustered together in a previous trial.

#### Challenges
One challenge for me would be to create this experiment in JsPsych, as I have little experience in coding through JsPsych. Another challenge would be the statistical analysis of the data, where they represented each word in a 89-dimensional space.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
